{{< project-description >}} <p>THERE MAY BE SOME BIAS HERE, BUT BASKETBALL IS THE GREATEST SPORT. More than that though is how the modern athlete has become more than just someone good at a sport. Today's professional athlete's exhibit a wide range of interests, talents, are a part of various business ventures and social causes.<p></p>Mason Plumlee is no exception. After being a huge star for Duke University and now a forward on the Denver Nuggets his interests cover a broad spectrum from tech start-ups, art collecting, health foods not to mention youth development and fitness.<p></p>To build on this and his personality we crafted for him an "anti-logo". A mark that can adapt to his mood, what's he's thinking or feeling, the time of year, the type of game he just had. Its a mark that carries his initials but also his feelings. A brand that is also a person does not need to feel corporate, not should it. If people are brands and vice versa we should let our emotions come through. Here's our approach at doing that.</p> {{< /project-description >}}
