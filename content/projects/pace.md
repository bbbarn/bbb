{{< project-description >}} <p>PACE IS STANDS OUT IN THE ATLANTA FITNESS COMMUNITY for moving a way from boot camp and ultra aggressive work out trends. Using the “Lagree Method” it still considered itself a high-intensity workout combining strength, endurance, core, cardio, balance and flexibility in to each workout. The name itself is a key focus to each workout. Maintain a slow, steady and even pace to yield stronger results you can feel. Because the Pace name already does so much for the brand narrative the word was intentionally left as the logo. Our strong-stance “A” was there for the taking to suggest the focus on body, balance, and being able to hold a difficult pose while muscles quaked and twitched.</p> {{< /project-description >}}
