{{< project-description >}} <p>THERE’S BEEN RESTAURANTS ON ROOFTOPS, IN BASEMENTS, ON THE WATER AND ON LAND, BUT MOLLY B’S OFFERS ONE OF THE MORE UNIQUE LOCATIONS we’ve had the opportunity to do the branding for. Molly B’s is located in Mercedes Benz Stadium, home to the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, monster trucks shows and rock concerts. Molly B’s is a chef driven restaurant situated right above the arena floor. You can be certain, no seat is a bad seat here!<p></p>Named after the owner of said sports teams’ late mother, this restaurant is a blend of super quality and down to earth home-cooked meals that brings stadium restaurant food to an unprecedented level. And, one of its best features is its open seven days a week. While matching team colors was a key ingredient it was really fun to approach this branding as if it were a stand alone restaurant on a quiet street in a small southern town while applying it to this big time, state-of-the-art arena. That juxtaposition was fun to toggle between without over-designing things. Simple graphics paired with our ‘steak knife / initial’ icon, some fun copy writing complete the branding. At some point there’s no denying that the atmosphere of 70,000+ cheering fans is reason enough to show up.</p> {{< /project-description >}}
