{{< project-description >}} <p>PARISH FOOD AND GOODS IS A NEW ORLEANS-INSPIRED BI-LEVEL RESTAURANT and market concept. When the project was first introduced it was a crumbling, graffiti covered, dilapidated wreck of a building. To be honest, an inspiring place to start and worth noting how far it's come. Now, it is a beautifully restored 1890s Factory Terminal Building in the heart of Inman Park Atlanta. It is defined by three concepts including PARISH Restaurant, The Market at PARISH and To-Go at PARISH. The eatery draws on the French and Spanish influences that make New Orleansâ€™ cuisine and culture a melting pot of simple pleasures..</p> <p>Each aspect of PARISH exudes the same comfortable casualness associated with the laid back New Orleans culture. Good food at moderate prices, quality company and comforting and unique, rustic design inevitably makes PARISH a destination. BoyBurnsBarn was responsible for creating the brand identity to coincide with both the vision for the restaurant and the physical space. Signage, labels, stationery and packaging were also created for the restaurant.</p><p> Last but not least, BBB designed and developed the website which won the Webby Award for the Restaurant category!</p>{{< /project-description >}}
