{{< project-description >}} <p>BASED ON PHOENIX, ARIZONA, POSTINO IS RUN BY SOME OF THE MOST FUN, PASSIONATE PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER MEET. Which means that Postino itself is like no other wine bar you will ever visit. And, somehow each of the seven locations are unique unto themselves while still being on brand! Yes, mindblowing...</p>
</p>Yet, even with a will cared for experience and a cult following they felt like it was time to do a brand audit and revisit their website. Enter BBB. What we discovered was a brand that was very serious about its food and wine but equally serious about its pop-culture inspirations of punk rock, 90’s era skateboard culture, street murals, art installations, surf culture and generally all things rad, weird and space invaders. How do we push it all together?</p> 
</p>A good cornerstone allows all things to be possible. We didn't redesign the logo, we infused it with some of that raw energy, art directed a video that puts people front and center and generally invited everyone and everything else that knows how to party to come along. Here's some of that!</p> {{< /project-description >}}
