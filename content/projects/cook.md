<p>COOK IS A CLOTHING BRAND WITH MANY EARTH SHIFTING ASPIRATIONS FOR ITSELF AND ITS CUSTOMERS. This is a vision conceived by world traveler, product developer and highly motivated Brit, Adam Meek. His travels helped shape his view of the world, the people in it and the products he valued and used most. Drawing from his expertise in crafting high-end products he set out to create high-quality, yet simplified clothing staples intended for high usage, durability and adaptiveness. But, the real kicker is he also wanted to see his brand bring people together, form bonds from great distances, reduce waste and make it easier to explore our world. The challenge was how to consolidate that vision into a brand narrative that’s digestible.<p></p>BBB entered the equation to help solve that brand story and add a little design notes of its own here and there. Adam’s muse for his brand is Captain James Cook who was a daring explorer and scientist of his age. He circumvented the globe several times in the 1700s and his contributions (both positive and negative) to our understanding of different cultures, astronomy, biology and much more are immense. Our job was to take the inspirations of Cook the person, and the aspirations of COOK the brand and make them one. We broke the brand’s goals down into three separate channels to focus on. The first is “the product.” Without it the rest does not matter. The second is “to inspire exploration.” The superior quality of the products and no nonsense design make them ready for any situation or environment thus easier to step outside and be on your way. The third is “community”. The people you meet on your travels really are the destination and are what make the world feel closer and more connected and thus more valuable to each of us.<p></p>BBB developed some added details to be a part of each garment to help connect the brand goals to the product. The tag designs on the shirts invites the owner to cut away a motivational phrase and tuck it somewhere meaningful to be found and seen when needed. The cap includes a small tag which requires someone to be rather close to read. It contains ‘where it was designed and made’ notes but ends with the sentence “Is friendship necessary for survival or a reason to survive?” An instant conversation starter for any one close enough to catch the question. Where normally tags serve as pure function, we adapted these moments to bridge the gap between product and brand goals, bring the humanity into a product making it more cherished and reached for. We also designed a series of patches dedicated to different moments of Captain Cook’s explorations. Each one will be a part of a different seasonal drop or product line. They each represent a different moment in Captain Cook’s story and why it matters today.<p></p>For the launch of the COOK brand the inaugural photoshoot was shot in Plymouth, UK where Captain Cook set sail on his maiden voyage to Tahiti to track the path of Venus across the sun in 1769. There could not be a more perfect setting of moody weather, daring coastline and pure historical significance to capture this brand’s introduction to society. COOK quickly becomes a product with global vision but is incredibly personal. We’re very excited to see where this brand goes but more excited to wear it on our next adventure!<p></p>Photos by: <a href="https://www.chrisboulton.co.uk/latest" target=”_blank”>Chris Boulton</a></p>
