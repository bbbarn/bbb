<p>THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE WE CAN SAY ABOUT HAMILTON THAT HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID. One of the greatest shows you’ll ever see / greatest night of your life / game changer / life changer… Yes, to all those things.</p>
<p>Through our continued collaboration with Creative Goods, we developed the concept and design of the souvenir book sold at the theater. The challenge of this book was how to compress a performance where the musical hip-hop influence are so important when juxtaposed with the visual into a two dimensional book. We chose to double down on the historical visual heritage of the performance while at the same time pushing the language and written words of Lin Manuel front and center. The words share the same visual weight of the imagery in our layout. This gives readers the chance to go back and really take in the depth of the flow, rhyme and weight of what is being spoken. We used vellum overlays to further show how its the words of the show float over what you’re seeing.</p>
