{{< project-description >}}
<p>CHICAGO’S HISTORIC NAVY PIER is an iconic piece of Chicago’s water front. It played a significant role in Chicago’s existence through World Fair’s and World War’s and is now a communal destination housing numerous dining and cultural experiences. At the end of that pier, and on the top of that pier is OFFSHORE. A rooftop bar and restaurant that is both enormous in its indoor and outdoor space but also in its views of Lake Michigan and the skyline of Chicago.</p>
<p>Some branding projects come to the table already full of concept, design and significance. Offshore is one of those projects. The key here is knowing when to let those elements shine while the branding and identity play an important but more supportive role. Given the location of the restaurant the word mark sits on the end of our pier icon creating a logo that can be as succinct or horizontally long as it wishes. This allowed for some fun signage experimentation while providing a functional, simple logo. The space is stunning. The views more so. This identity puts a strong but simple stamp on this iconic location.</p>
