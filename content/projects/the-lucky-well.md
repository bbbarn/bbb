{{< project-description >}}
<p>The Lucky Well, helmed by chef Chad Rosenthal, brings his stylized version of authentic BBQ to the northeast and gives people a reason to drive north of Philly for a special dining experience. Located in Ambler, Pennsylvania, a cozy and attractive town, The Lucky Well sits right on Main St. as a perfect compliment to its shopping and cultural neighbors. BoyBurnsBarn was asked to create a brand that blends the comfort food aura of BBQ with a more fine dining experience that still feels casual. </p>
<p>The Lucky Well used to be famous hotel in the region that no longer exists. Old post cards of Ambler often featured the Lucky Well hotel as a main town feature. Chad chose to adopt the name and bring it back to its iconic status. We embraced the name and loved the idea of combining a BBQ vibe with some good luck tokens. A horse shoe sits prominently in the logo while other support graphics feature more than a dozen lucky pennies… floating softly into that “lucky well”. And, of course, lets not forget our illustrated cooker with its lucky penny puffs of smoke!</p>
