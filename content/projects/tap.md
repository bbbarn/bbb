{{< project-description >}}
<p>OPENED IN 2007, TAP IS ATLANTA’S FIRST GASTROPUB. While it serves seasonally driven, innovative comfort food, it is named for the restaurant’s extensive draft beer and barrel wine selection which rests in a glass chamber floating above the bar.</p>
<p>The collateral designed for the restaurant encapsulates the environment of a great community pub by being conversation pieces unto themselves. The menu, for example, serves as a tour guide more than a menu and it is something you might want to keep around since it contains a Beer Flavor Wheel on the back. Coasters offer remedial trivia that could keep a lull in conversation from happening or can help solve a bar bet. Each element engages the patrons and creates a bond between establishment and customer. From the creation of the logo to the small nuances that exist inside and out, this carefully crafted brand has made a strong impact on Peachtree Street.</p>
