<p>WHEN YOU GET A PHONE CALL FROM A CLIENT ASKING YOU TO WORK ON THEIR NEW PROJECT CALLED “THE CRACK SHACK” It’s a bit hard not to gasp. Now that it’s all said and done there couldn’t be a more perfect name for this in your face yet elegant all day chicken and eggs concept in San Diego, California. Located in what originally was, for lack of a better term, a metal “shack” on the back lot of an existing property owned by Michael Rosen of Juniper and Ivy, The Crack Shack is the place we all wanted in our lives but maybe didn’t know we needed.</p>
<p>Having worked with Mr. Rosen before, as well as Top Chef All Star Richard Blais, who is the chef behind the menu, we knew that nothing is too out there but everything would still be carefully considered. That combination is the perfect branding mixture for us to really have funner. Starting with such an aggressive name that is both fun to say and hear, we wanted to make sure the branding matched up visually to that tone. We chose the ultra thick heavy, letters of Base to capture the sound of the words while the big round shape of the letters gives it a certain eggy-ness. Not to be missed are the two cracked egg shells found in the negative spaces of the “A’s”</p>
